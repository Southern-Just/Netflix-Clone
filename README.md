# 🎬 Netflix-Inspired Design Project 🎨💻
I had this awesome idea to use Netflix as my design inspiration in Figma. Now, let’s delve into the serious coding—after all, that's what we do! 🛠️🚀

✨ What's Inside?
🎨 Design: A sleek, modern Netflix-style UI/UX because, let's face it, Netflix has always nailed that aesthetic!
💻 Code Implementation: The process is supposed to be iterative but boy, do i doubt that 😊
🛠️ Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, Vite, and good ol' HTML/CSS 💻
Backend: Firebase for real-time functionality 🔥
🌟 Highlights
Smooth animations for that cinematic experience 🎥✨
Responsive design across all devices 📱💻
Interactive elements that mimic Netflix’s clean and intuitive interface 🖱️
